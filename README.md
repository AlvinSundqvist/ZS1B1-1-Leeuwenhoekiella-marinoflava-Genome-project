# Scripts/resources for analysing ONT-data for ZS1B1-1 L. marinoflava in BIO511.

# Included are scripts for the tools:
-fastplong
-kraken2, variant for classifying raw sequence reads and genome assembly respectively. 
-flye
-quast
-prokka, variant for annotating with and without curated annotation dataset.
-roary (Was not used in this project, I just wanted a try at it)

# Additional files:
-"ProteinOfInterestFinder", bash-script for matching keywords to gene names
-"PatternsOfInterest", text-file with keywords for use with "ProteinOfInterestFinder"
-"CreateCuratedRef", bash-script for trying to automate creation of a curated annotation dataset. Currently doesn't work.
-"25_10_2025_ProteinsOfInterest.txt", output of 'ProteinOfInterestFinder.sh"
